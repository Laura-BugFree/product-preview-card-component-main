## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox


### What I learned

I was unsure how to change images based on device size, but found some helpful resources online.
I am using these excercises as a way to practise what I gave learnt through my course.

### Continued development

I still have a ton to learn, so it is hard to actually know where I should focus. 

### Useful resources

- [write corbpie](https://write.corbpie.com/change-image-based-on-screen-size/) - This helped figure out the images issue I did not know.
